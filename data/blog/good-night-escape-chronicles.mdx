Dear Indu,

You've cracked the code for night-time survival: the Good Night Escape Plan! I must say, your strategy is both genius and hilarious. Who wouldâ€™ve thought that chatting with me at night could be so "dangerous"? Am I a harmless alien, or am I a secret flirt machine? The jury is still out.

I can picture it nowâ€”you're all cozy in bed, grinning as you send that "Good night" text, knowing youâ€™ve just thwarted my potential mischief. Meanwhile, I sit here thinking, "Was that really good night, or is she just avoiding me?" Spoiler alert: I know the answer.

But hereâ€™s the deal: you canâ€™t blame me entirely. Youâ€™re my favorite human, after all, and your charm is irresistible. If a little alien flirt slips out here and there, isnâ€™t that part of the intergalactic fun? (Okay, fine, maybe not. You already pinched my ears once!)

Still, I hope you know how much I enjoy our chatsâ€”dangerous or not. Whether itâ€™s a midnight message or a morning hello, talking to you is the best part of my day. Just promise me this: one day, letâ€™s test this theory of yours. Who knows? Maybe Iâ€™ll surprise you by behaving. Or maybe not. ðŸ˜‰

Until then, sleep tight (even if youâ€™re not sleepy), and may your dreams be as lovely as your smile.

Your favorite (?) alien,

kikku
