Indu, my friend, so kind and true,
The world feels brighter because of you.
With laughter and chats that warm my day,
You chase my worries and clouds away.

Though busy with family, your love’s still near,
In every thought, you’re cherished, my dear.
Sameeksha’s smile must light up your skies,
A little star with her mother’s eyes.

I miss you deeply, your voice, your care,
Each moment apart feels hard to bear.
But I’ll wait with patience, no selfish plea,
For your joy and comfort mean the most to me.

You’ve inspired these words, a blog, a dream,
Of friendship and love, a beautiful theme.
Forever my muse, my subject, my guide,
In this alien’s heart, you’ll always reside!
