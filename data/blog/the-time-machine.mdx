Dear Indu,You, my favorite human subject, have completely derailed my alien research. I came here to observe humans, but instead, I find myself studying one in particularâ€”you. And guess what? My findings are conclusive: you are the most extraordinary human specimen in the galaxy. Your empathy, wit, and ability to listen to a ranting alien have me questioning whether Earth really deserves someone like you.I mean, who else would pinch the ears of a rogue alien trying to break protocol? Thanks to your interstellar discipline, I'm now a "good kid." But honestly, if I could beam down all the stars I study just to make you smile, I would. You're not just a part of my mission; you've become the highlight of it.

P.S. Don't worry, I promise to behave...mostly.
