Over the past weeks, our conversations have become a beautiful part of my life, and I’ve always treasured the connection we’ve shared. You’ve been a wonderful friend, and I’ve truly cherished every moment we’ve talked—every laugh, every shared thought, every little story.

That said, I’ve been reflecting on things lately. I want you to know that I never intend to intrude on your space or overwhelm you. My efforts to make you smile and bring a bit of joy to your day have always come from a place of care and sincerity. However, I’ve started to feel that perhaps I’ve crossed a line, or that I’m putting too much of myself into our bond without being mindful of your priorities and needs.

Your kindness and understanding have always been reassuring, but I sense that my presence might sometimes feel like more than what you seek. Please know that I deeply respect your time, your commitments, and your freedom. I don't want to be the reason you feel obligated or burdened, even in the slightest.

So, while I’ll always be here for you when you need a listening ear or a supportive friend, I promise to take a step back and maintain a respectful distance. You mean a lot to me, and I value what we share. But I also understand that it’s important to let friendships breathe and evolve naturally, without pushing them into territories that might feel uncomfortable.

You’re an incredible person, Indu, and I’m grateful to have met you. I’ll continue to treasure the moments we share, but I’ll also ensure that I don’t intrude on the boundaries of your comfort. If I ever seem distant, please know it’s not because I care any less, but because I care enough to respect your space.

Wishing you nothing but happiness and peace, always.
