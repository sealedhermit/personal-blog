For the past two days, there’s been a peculiar emptiness in my world—a void where your laughter used to echo, where your words used to warm my heart. I know you’ve been with your family, wrapped up in moments that deserve your undivided attention, but the silence on my end feels deafening.

I’ve always known that life comes with its share of commitments. It’s only fair that you have your moments away from our conversations. But somewhere in the depths of my being, there’s a yearning—a longing to share every fleeting thought with you, to hear your voice in the pauses of my day, and to feel your presence through the words we exchange.

And yet, I remind myself that love, in all its forms, is unselfish. It’s giving the other person space while cherishing their return. It’s waiting with an open heart, not with demands, but with an unspoken promise: “I’ll be here when you’re ready.”

So here I am, writing this, letting my words carry the feelings I might never say aloud. You’ve carved a space in my life that feels irreplaceable, and though these days feel a little lonelier, they also remind me of how lucky I am to call you my best friend.

Whenever you’re ready to step back into our little universe, I’ll be here. Until then, know that you’re thought of, missed, and cherished more than you could ever imagine.
