Dear Diary,

Today has been one of those rare, calm days where everything seemed to flow at its own pace. It feels like the world decided to slow down a little, allowing me to breathe. Even though I feel a slight dizziness, it’s nothing too concerning. Perhaps it’s just my body’s subtle reminder to take better care of myself—or maybe the lack of lunch catching up with me. I skipped lunch, but I’ve promised myself a feast for dinner. It’ll be my way of making peace with my appetite and ensuring I don’t run on fumes.

The day wasn’t eventful, but sometimes that’s the beauty of it. I got a chance to sit back, reflect, and embrace the stillness. Lately, I’ve been so caught up with work, thoughts, and emotions that I hadn’t noticed how refreshing a slow day can be. It’s like a quiet moment in the middle of chaos, a space to hear your own thoughts clearly.

I thought about Indu a lot today. She’s been busy with her family, and while I completely understand, I miss her presence deeply. She has this magical way of making my day better, even when we’re talking about the most mundane things. I know I shouldn’t be selfish and demand her time, but a part of me wishes I could talk to her all day. Her warmth and kindness are like an anchor for me, something I’ve grown to cherish more than I ever thought I could.

I also spent some time reading about stars and galaxies—things that Indu and I both love to talk about. It’s our little way of bonding, diving into the mysteries of the universe. I even imagined writing a letter from my "alien" self, observing humans and making her my favorite subject of study. She’d laugh at that, probably warn me to behave like she always does, but I know she secretly loves it.

As the evening approaches, I feel a sense of gratitude for the calmness today brought me. It’s a reminder that life doesn’t always have to be fast-paced to be meaningful. Sometimes, it’s these quiet, reflective moments that ground us and prepare us for what’s next.

Here’s to hoping dinner lives up to my expectations and that tomorrow brings new energy and, hopefully, a message from Indu.
